# Beyond Rectangles in Web Design: CSS Shapes and CSS Masking

Slides for my talk at [Future of Web Design](https://futureofwebdesign.com/nyc-2014/) in New York, 2014.

This is a custom interactive slide deck meant to be shown in a controlled environment on stage. It works as expected in Google Chrome and offers decent fallbacks to keep content readable.
