# Let's Talk About Shapes: CSS Shapes and CSS Masking

Slides for my talk at [infoShare 2015](https://infoshare.pl/) in Gda≈Ñsk, Poland.

This is a custom interactive slide deck meant to be shown in a controlled environment on stage. It works as expected in Google Chrome and offers reasonable fallbacks to keep content readable, but not all demos may work well in other browsers.
